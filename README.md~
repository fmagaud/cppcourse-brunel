	A. Presentation of the program:

This program can simulate a cortical activity following N. BRUNEL’s model and produce a file which contains the time and the neuron’s number of each spike that occurred during the simulation. This data can be used to create a graph.

The cortex contains 10000 excitatory neurons and 2500 inhibitory neurons.
Each neuron has a membrane potential and when they reach a certain value they spike and send a potential JE or JI (whether they’re excitatory or inhibitory) to the neurons they’re connected to. A random background noise is produced: each neuron receives a random number of JE.

The user can choose:
	- the time of simulation (in ms)
	- the time step (in ms)
       - 2 parameters of the model:
             .g which is the JI/JE ratio
             .ETA which is the rate of the background noise (it is used 
              to produce the random numbers of JE received)

	B. Compilation:
	
The program is compiled with cMake. To do so, the command:
	“cmake ..”
must be thrown from the repertory “build”.

- To run the program, the command:
	“./simulation”
must be thrown from the repertory “build”.
- To run the tests, the command:
	“./unit+AF8-test”
must be thrown from the repertory “build”.


	C. Utilisation:
   
Once the program has started, the user will be asked to give:
       - the time of simulation (in ms)
       - the time step (in ms)
       - the g parameter
       - the ETA parameter

When the program is done, the data can be found in the “spikes.txt” file, located in the “build” repertory.
